# rm3100ArduinoTest
Use arduino Uno wifi to talk with RM3100.

### Compare Data
The arrow printed on the RM3100 modules indicates the intended line-of-sight. The RM3100
modules are arranged in a north-east-down (NED) coordinate system, and the arrow is
parallel to the x-axis sensor. When the module is pointing directly magnetic south, the x-axis
reading will be maximized and the y-axis will be zero. In similar fashion, when the module is
pointing west, the y-axis reading will be maximized and the x-axis reading will be zero. The
z-axis reading will depend on the dip angle at the given location. At the geomagnetic equator,
where Earthâ€™s magnetic field is horizontal, the z-axis reading will be zero when flat.
